# Spam_Detection_Using_Ml_Algorithims


We will look at text message data in this project and create models to figure out when a message is spam or not. This is a problem with Supervised Text Classification. The following features of the dataset, that can be found in the same directory as spam.csv, are included:

Steps Involved:

Data Cleaning: Dealing with incorrect encodings, removing unnecessary/invalid features
Data Exploration: Find high frequency words for spam vs not spam messages, explore features such as average length of document, average no. of digits per document and average no. of non-words per document
Data Preprocessing: Converting the text features into vectors using TFIDF vectorizer
Model Training: Training different classification models-Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVM and Logistic Regression
Evaluation: Comparing the accuracy and recall scores for different models to select the most suitable one
